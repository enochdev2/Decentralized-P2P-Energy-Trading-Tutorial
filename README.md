# Sample Hardhat Project

Decentralized P2P Energy Trading Simulation

This project simulates a blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading model between a Prosumer (who produces and sells energy) and a Consumer (who buys and consumes energy). It uses a smart contract to handle energy trades in kilowatt-hours (kWh), recording transactions, prices, and payments on-chain.

The simulation includes test scenarios to measure performance metrics such as transaction time, verification time, gas cost, and scalability. This model is compared to traditional utility-based (centralized) energy billing systems.

ðŸ”§ Built with Solidity
ðŸ§ª Tested using Hardhat
ðŸ“Š Metrics can be extended using Python or MATLAB for further analysis

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
